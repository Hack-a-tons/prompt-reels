## What You'll See

- **Total requests**: Shows how many API calls will be made
- **Progress counter**: `[5/15] (33.3%)` - Current position and percentage
- **Rate limiting**: When waiting between requests
- **Real-time results**: Score and latency for each evaluation
- **Iteration summary**: Final weights and best prompt selected

## Timing

With **3 domains Ã— 5 prompts = 15 requests** per iteration:
- Rate limit: ~30 seconds between requests
- **Total time per iteration**: ~7.5 minutes
- **3 iterations**: ~22-23 minutes

You'll see progress in real-time so you know it's working!
